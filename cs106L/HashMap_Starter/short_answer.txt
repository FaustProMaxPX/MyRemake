Assignment 3: STL HashMap (short answer questions)
Names:

1. at() just get the mapped value, the map needs this function no matter it's const or not.
    But operator[] will also insert a {key, value} to map if the key doesn't exist, 
    It's obviously that const map doesn't need this function, so we can just ignore it.

2. map.find() is faster, it uses hash function. std::find just iterator over the container.

3. It's RAII. All the map's resources would be released in its deconstructor. 

4. move pointer to next element, if next is null, find next bucket that is not null 
    and point to its first element. finally, return current object.
    check : if current bucket has iterated completely, if the whole map has been iterated.

5. For HashMapIterator, we can directly assign value to its field, so the default smf is enough. But for HashMap
    We need to consider about allocating memeory, and manage the pointer, so we implement it by ourselves.

6. Tough the parameter itself is an r-value, but when it is passed to a function, formal parameter combine
    with it and the formal parameter is an l-value. So, we still need to use std::move.
